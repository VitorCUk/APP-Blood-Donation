# APP-Blood-DonationV1

This application is also under development as a portfolio of the Full Stack Developer course that I am teaching at RocketSeat. 


The basis of this FPA is the collection of new blood donors and also a database that will support institutions in the future. 

The technology used was:

HTML
CSS
JAVAScript 
Node.js
Server. 

In the future this APP will be connected to a SQL data base. 

Version 2.0 will be updated soon.
